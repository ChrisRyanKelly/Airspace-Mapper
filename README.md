# Airspace-Mapper
Map the wireless attack surface. Airspace Mapper passively captures and enriches WPA handshakes with GPS, vendor, and signal strength data—outputting JSON + GPX files for Red Team reconnaissance, target triage, and toolchain integration. Inspired by CyberArk’s large-scale WiFi recon.
